# Rubik's Cube Solver

## Overview
This project involves modeling a real-world object, a Rubik's Cube, into a computer-understandable format and developing a complete solver. The project is structured to break down the larger problem into smaller, manageable tasks using object-oriented programming principles and various pathfinding algorithms.

## Key Learnings

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Classes and Objects:** We utilized classes to represent the Rubik's Cube and other components.
- **Virtual Functions and Abstract Classes:** Implemented abstract classes to define interfaces for solvers and cube representations.
- **Inheritance:** Used inheritance to extend base classes for specific implementations.
- **Operator Overloading:** Overloaded operators to simplify operations on custom objects like cube states.

### Pathfinding Algorithms
- **BFS, DFS, IDDFS, and IDA\*:** These algorithms were applied to solve the Rubik's Cube, demonstrating their practical use in AI.
- **Heuristic Search Algorithms (A\* and IDA\*):** Developed heuristic functions using Pattern Databases to optimize the search process.

### Additional Learnings
- **Custom Data Structures:** Implemented `unordered_map` for custom objects and created custom hash functions.
- **Bit Manipulation:** Used bits to store information efficiently.
- **File Operations:** Learned how to save and load files for persistent storage.
- **Black Box Concept:** Applied the black box approach, particularly with the Permutation Indexer, to abstract complexity.
